<h2>About Tevyah Hanley</h2>
<p class="intro"><span class="sentence">Hey y'all! I am Tevyah Hanley, I am software development student who has been programming since I was 15!</span> I am from Cleveland Ohio, but now am located in Columbus as of very recently. I started off learning Web Development ie. HTML, CSS, & Javascript, before moving onto other languages like Python and C#. </p>
<p>With programming it has taken me farther than I expected, which I am very grateful for, I have won a couple of hackathons with Web Development, which was huge for me. I even just landed an internship which is coming to a close with IT at Chipotle! Just on Friday I have landed a more long term role with IT at Chipotle, something I am super excited about but it has me very busy! </p>
<p>I am now currently looking for a more long-term place so it has been a quick search for my new home. I didn't think that life would happen so quickly, but I am glad it is. I look forward to the journey that this has for me. </p>
